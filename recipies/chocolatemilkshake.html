    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> This is something my mom use to make for us kids as a cool treat on a warm day. It is a rich chocolate treat.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups vanilla ice cream</li>
        <li>½ cup whole milk</li>
        <li>¼ cup powdered chocolate drink mix</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon powdered egg whites</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> In a blender, combine the ice cream, milk, chocolate drink mix and powdered egg whites. Cover, and blend until smooth. You may need to stop and stir once or twice to get it evenly mixed. The shake will be very thick.</li>
